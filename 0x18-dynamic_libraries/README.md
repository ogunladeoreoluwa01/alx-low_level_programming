# Dynamic Library Project

This project focuses on creating and using dynamic libraries in C, along with understanding related concepts and tools.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Explain what a dynamic library is, how it works, and how to create one.
- Understand and utilize the environment variable `$LD_LIBRARY_PATH`.
- Differentiate between static and shared libraries.
- Demonstrate basic usage of `nm`, `ldd`, and `ldconfig`.

## Project Overview

This project consists of tasks related to dynamic libraries in C. The tasks cover various aspects such as creating dynamic libraries, understanding environment variables, and using tools for library analysis.

## Project Structure

The project includes the following components:

- **C Files:** C source code files for the dynamic library tasks.
- **Header File:** main.h containing prototypes for functions and \_putchar.
- **Bash Scripts:** Scripts for testing and related tasks.
- **README.md:** This file, providing an overview of the project and instructions.

## Requirements

### C Files

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs.
- Compilation on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc with specified options.
- Code should follow the Betty style.
- No global variables allowed.
- Limited to 5 functions per file.
- Forbidden to use standard library functions (e.g., printf, puts).
- Allowed to use \_putchar (do not push \_putchar.c).
- Prototypes must be included in main.h.

### Bash Scripts

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs.
- Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
- Files end with a new line.
- First line of all scripts must be exactly #!/bin/bash.
- README.md for each script explaining its purpose.
- All files must be executable.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository.
2. Compile the C files using specified options.
3. Execute Bash scripts for testing.

## Additional Notes

- Do not push \_putchar.c; it will not be considered.
- The provided main.c files are for testing; do not push them.
