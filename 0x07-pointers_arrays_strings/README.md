This directory continues the topics, pointers, arrays and strings. Here we will learn how to point to a pointer and see examples of two dimensional arrays as well as how to manipulate them. This directory contains the following files and their purpose:
0-memset.c: fill a memory with a constant byte
1-memcpy.c: copies memory area
2-strchr.c: locates a character in a string
3-strspn.c: it gets the lenght of a prefix substring
4-strpbrk.c: searches a string for a set of bytes
5-strstr.c: locates a substring
7-print-chessboard.c: prints a chessboard pattern
8-print-diagsums.c: prints the sum of the diagonals of an array.

The above files are the source files for functions that carry out the files objectives.
