This directory focuses on pointers, arrays, and strings. It contains the following files and their respective purposes:

1. `0-memset.c`: This file implements the `memset` function, which fills a block of memory with a specified constant byte.

2. `1-memcpy.c`: This file contains the `memcpy` function, which copies a specified number of bytes from one memory location to another.

3. `2-strchr.c`: Here, the `strchr` function is implemented to locate the first occurrence of a character in a given string.

4. `3-strspn.c`: This file provides the `strspn` function, which calculates the length of a prefix substring in a string. It determines how many characters in the beginning of the string match a given set of characters.

5. `4-strpbrk.c`: The `strpbrk` function is defined in this file. It searches a string for any character from a specified set of bytes and returns a pointer to the first occurrence.

6. `5-strstr.c`: Here, the `strstr` function is implemented. It locates the first occurrence of a substring within a string and returns a pointer to it.

7. `7-print-chessboard.c`: This file contains the `print_chessboard` function, which prints a chessboard pattern using a two-dimensional array.

8. `8-print-diagsums.c`: In this file, the `print_diagsums` function is implemented. It prints the sums of the diagonals in a given array.

Each of these files provides a specific function that accomplishes its respective objective.
