This is a directory that contains work on argc and argv commands in c. it is how we pass arguments to our main functions outside the program. it contains the following files:
0-whatsmyname.c: prints out the file name
1-args.c: prints out the argc ie number of arguments passed to the function
2-args.c: prints out all the arguments that are passed tot he function
3-mul.c: Multiplies all the arguments passed to it
4-add.c: Adds all numbers passed to it
100-change.c: it prints the no of coins needed to make 'change' for the arg.

The work here is from the original owner of the repository and is created by him
