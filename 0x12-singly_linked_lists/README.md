This repository contains solutions to various problems related to singly linked lists in the C programming language. Singly linked lists are a fundamental data structure in computer science, and this project provides a collection of functions and examples that demonstrate their usage.This repository contains work on the topic, linked lists. Here we see a new data structure that is different from the array that we have looked at so far, Linked lists. Linked lists are a way to store data in a non contigious memory block, ie the memory address are not stored at consecutive memory locations.
