This repository contains a collection of header files that serve as examples for practicing and understanding macros. These macros are designed to simplify code and demonstrate the important role of the preprocessor in the compilation process. The files included are as follows:

1. 0-object-like-macro.h: Defines a macro with the value 1024.
2. 1-pi.h: Creates a macro that represents the value of pi.
3. 2-main.c: A program that utilizes the predefined macro **FILE** to print the current file name.
4. 3-function-like-macro.h: Defines a macro that functions similar to a function, calculating and returning the absolute value of a number.
5. 4-sum.h: Implements a macro that performs the addition of two numbers.

It is important to note that these files are original creations by the owner of the repository and should not be copied or modified without permission. The purpose of this project is to contribute to the ALX Software Engineering curriculum.
